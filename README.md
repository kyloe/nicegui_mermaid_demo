This is a work in progress demo for nicegui/mermaid interaction

It relies on a PR that is currently pending at nicegui whcih adds the option to 
downgrade security to 'loose' and thereby allow clicking of nodes to trigger
javascript functions.

These functions can be used to emit events - which can be trapped by 
'on.ui' calls in nicegui

Its all 'prrof of concept' just now - happy to help if anyone want's to use/abuse it 

I.
